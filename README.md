### Build steps

> Note: If you're using Windows, you'll need to use WSL. 

First, install all of the dependencies using `npm install`. You will also need to install [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html). 

Then, build the the wasm files using `npm run build-wasm`, which will do the following:
- Clone the tree-sitter repository
- Build the tree-sitter WebAssembly bindings
- Build the tree-sitter grammars listed in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-tree-sitter-wasm/blob/alexr00/0.0.1/build/main.ts
